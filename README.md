# discord-emoji-stealer

Downloads every custom emoji from every Discord server you're in.

## Usage

You need to have a running Discord client in order for this script to work.
Tested on Windows 10 x64 only, please create an issue if it is incompatible with your platform.

[node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and npm (included with node.js) are required to get this going.

1. Clone this repository, or [download its latest revision](https://github.com/Tenrys/discord-emoji-stealer/archive/master.zip).
    - If you downloaded the repository, it will be a `.zip` file to extract.
2. Open a command prompt / terminal inside of the repository's folder.
3. Run `npm i`. This will install the script's dependencies.
4. Run `node index.js`. This will run the script.
5. The script should now start downloading every custom emoji of every server you're in, one by one, in an adjacent folder called `emojis`. It'll exit automatically when it's done.
